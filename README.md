IoT Empowering Me, an IoT / mobile-app product designed to help individuals live more empowered lives within the community.

This product uses hardware and software to help empower individuals, caretakers, and group dynamics for successful, empowered community experiences. The need for this product comes from my experience working with service providers at Golden Gate Regional Center, a non-profit agency with a mission for helping persons with developmental disabilities to live independent lives within the community. Given scarce financial resources for funding, sometimes it can be challenging for funding as many staff members as might be optimal. This product has the hope of being used as a support in such a situation.

Who can benefit: service providers leading teams into a public space, parents keeping an eye on kids in a crowded environment, and other situations where external stimulii can be overwhelming.

Hardware: Arduino micorcontroller, cellular connectivity, GPS geo-location, BLE bluetooth for geofencing

Software: API RESTful API data access, React/Redux, Firebase, React Native

The unveling of the prototype is set for the San Mateo Maker's Faire, May 18 - 20, 2018. Please come visit us!
